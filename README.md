# Linear_Regression
An algorithm for calculating linear regression
The idea is that we take a measurement multiple times and calculate linear regression off of it.
For example,
  Say we shoot a cannon ball out of a cannon.
  Imagine we have a set number of sensors 'n' to measure the instantaneous velocity of the ball at 'n' different positions.
  We can then enter the values into a program using linear regression to tell us the likely true path of the cannonball.
  
For this program, the user enters the number of "measurements" to be taken, but then the "measurements" are random numbers, intentially generated to produce a linear regression.
